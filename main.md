1. Initialize the project, which downloads a plugin called a provider that lets Terraform interact with Docker.
>terraform init
2.Check
>terraform plan
3. I can see error on my local machine
    Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.

4. >terraform plan
    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource
actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
