1. 
"The terraform {} block contains Terraform settings, including the required providers Terraform will use to provision your infrastructure. For each provider, the source attribute defines an optional hostname, a namespace, and the provider type. Terraform installs providers from the Terraform Registry by default. In this example configuration, the aws provider's source is defined as hashicorp/aws, which is shorthand for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws."

2. 
"The provider block configures the specified provider, in this case aws. A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to create and manage your resources.

You can use multiple provider blocks in your Terraform configuration to manage resources from different providers. You can even use different providers together. For example, you could pass the IP address of your AWS EC2 instance to a monitoring resource from DataDog."

3. 
"Use resource blocks to define components of your infrastructure. A resource might be a physical or virtual component such as an EC2 instance, or it can be a logical resource such as a Heroku application.

Resource blocks have two strings before the block: the resource type and the resource name. In this example, the resource type is aws_instance and the name is app_server. The prefix of the type maps to the name of the provider. In the example configuration, Terraform manages the aws_instance resource with the aws provider. Together, the resource type and resource name form a unique ID for the resource. For example, the ID for your EC2 instance is aws_instance.app_server."

4. 
>terraform init

"Terraform downloads the aws provider and installs it in a hidden subdirectory of your current working directory, named .terraform. The terraform init command prints out which version of the provider was installed. Terraform also creates a lock file named .terraform.lock.hcl which specifies the exact provider versions used, so that you can control when you want to update the providers used for your project."

5. 
>terraform fmt
"We recommend using consistent formatting in all of your configuration files. The terraform fmt command automatically updates configurations in the current directory for readability and consistency.

Format your configuration. Terraform will print out the names of the files it modified, if any. In this case, your configuration file was already formatted correctly, so Terraform won't return any file names."

6. 
>terraform validate
"make sure your configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent by using the terraform validate command.

Validate your configuration. The example configuration provided above is valid, so Terraform will return a success message."

7. Create infrastructure
>terraform apply

8. Inspect the current state
>terraform show
"When you applied your configuration, Terraform wrote data into a file called terraform.tfstate. Terraform stores the IDs and properties of the resources it manages in this file, so that it can update or destroy those resources going forward.

The Terraform state file is the only way Terraform can track which resources it manages, and often contains sensitive information, so you must store your state file securely and restrict access to only trusted team members who need to manage your infrastructure. In production, we recommend storing your state remotely with Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise. Terraform also supports several other remote backends you can use to store and manage your state."

9. 
>terraform state list
"Terraform has a built-in command called terraform state for advanced state management. Use the list subcommand to list of the resources in your project's state."
